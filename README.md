<h1>Fiery Blizz</h1>
<p>
  <i> Fiery Blizz </i> is a multi-platform game that is developed in Unity and heavily inspired by legendary iOS game Flappy Bird. This particular project was my first attempt at creating a Unity2D game. You play as a dragon trying to escape the harsh snowy terrain. Don't forget to collect dragonfruits on your way!. <br> Here's the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IylN9DCqIqAu2ShTzLta8nDGLNaN9zMj/view?usp=drive_link">link</a> to the apk file.
